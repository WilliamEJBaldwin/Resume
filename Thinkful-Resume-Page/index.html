          Welcome! I am William Baldwin
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am a software developer currently residing in Springfield, Ohio.
        <br>
          As a hobbyist board and card game designer, I am motivated to:
          <div class = "table">
            <ol id = "horizontal-list"> 
              <li>Make software that that rolls through intended tasks like dice on a smooth felt table.</li>
              <li>Develop and update functionality to keep drawing those optimal performance cards.</li>
              <li>Write clean code that is easily understood like a simple rulebook.</li> 
            </ol>
          </div>  
        </p>

        <h3>About William</h3>  
        <p>
          Working with other game designers gave me great pleasure while also teaching me good techniques for collaboration. 
          After having 2 of my games published, I wanted to think about how I could showcase them better and build a website for my designs.
          I soon fell in love with the possibilities of web development and coding in general.
          <br>
          <br>
          The feeling I had when 2 independent companies entrusted my work with so much of their capital, time, and effort was euphoric. I hope to gain that same respect and trust in my future employer as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a student at <a href = "http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I am overjoyed with the path to my future as a software developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for a developer with a thirst for knowledge that can fit your team, please reach out through my <a href= mailto "wejbaldwin@yahoo.com ">email</a>. 
          I am eager to join in, collaborate, problem solve, and learn. 
          My favorite thing to eliminate in life: the possibility of disappointment!
